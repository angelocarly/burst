# Burst

The Burst Graphics library.

## Documentation
Burst uses [VKT](../vkt/README.md) for managing Vulkan functionality.  

### TODO
- Should Vulkan calls in Burst itself be kept to a minimum?
  - Writing abstractions for all Vulkan functionality is a lot of work.
  - But it would be nice to have a single library that can be used for all Vulkan functionality.
